## What I consider important in development
While I believe it's a good practice to leverage packages and libraries appropriately for developing high-quality environments, an excessive focus on developer convenience can lead to an inflated project size and overuse of server resources. If this results in an ill-suited development environment for the platform, it could significantly degrade the user experience.

Therefore, `I believe maintaining a balance between the developer experience and user experience is very crucial.`
