# How I Fell Into the World of Code
My coding journey began back in middle school when I first became fascinated with Java. Soon after, I started learning C, which gave me a deeper understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level.

During that time, I realized the underlying causes of memory leaks—not just experiencing them, but truly understanding how they happen.

After that, I gradually became more and more interested in object-oriented programming.

A year or two later, I started exploring web development, which naturally led to an interest in mobile apps. Then I discovered Flutter, and I absolutely fell in love with it—so much that I almost treated it like a favorite character.

From there, I studied Jetpack Compose, and after buying a MacBook, I began learning Swift, which eventually led me to SwiftUI. Since then, I have been consistently developing and maintaining packages for both Flutter and Jetpack Compose.
