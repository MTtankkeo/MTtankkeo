# How I Fell Into the World of Code
My coding journey began back in middle school when I first became fascinated with Java. Soon after, I started learning C, which gave me a deeper understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level.

During that time, I realized the underlying causes of memory leaksâ€”not just experiencing them, but truly understanding how they happen.

After that, I gradually became more and more interested in object-oriented programming.

A year or two later, I started exploring web development, which naturally led to an interest in mobile apps. Then I discovered Flutter, and I absolutely fell in love with itâ€”so much that I almost treated it like a favorite character.

From there, I studied Jetpack Compose, and after buying a MacBook, I began learning Swift, which eventually led me to SwiftUI. Since then, I have been consistently developing and maintaining packages for both Flutter and Jetpack Compose.

# ðŸš€ My Open Sources
I take great pride in building and maintaining tools that solve real problems for developers. Rather than just contributing to existing projects, I've focused on creating my own open source libraries across multiple ecosystemsâ€”Flutter, Jetpack Compose, React, and Webpack.

From frontend UIs to build toolchains, I enjoy crafting flexible, reusable, and thoughtfully designed packages. My work reflects a balance between practical usability and architectural cleanliness.

Hereâ€™s a curated list of my open source projects:

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Do This
Open source isnâ€™t just a side projectâ€”it's my way of sharing the tools I wish existed, and making development more enjoyable for others. Whether it's improving developer experience, abstracting repetitive logic, or enhancing UI interactivity, I create packages with **real-world use cases and long-term maintainability in mind**!
